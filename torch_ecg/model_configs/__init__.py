Problems:
---------
1. CNN:
    1.1. small scale:
        filter length (kernel size, dilation), downsampling (stride),
        these mainly depend on frequency bands of regions of interest,
        like QRS complex, P wave, T wave, or even intervals like qt interval,
        and also finer structures like notches on QRS complexes
    1.2. large scale:
        network depth, and block structures (e.g. ResNet v.s. VGG);
        upsampling?
2. RNN:
    2.1. choice between LSTM and attention
    2.2. use the last state for the last classifying layer or use the whole sequence

Frequency bands (from literature):
----------------------------------
QRS complex: 8 - 25 Hz
P wave: 5 - 20 Hz
T wave: 2.5 - 7 Hz
notch: 30 - 50 Hz (?)
NOTE that different literatures have different conlusions,
the above takes into considerations of many literatures

Frequency bands (from ludb ref. [4]):
-------------------------------------
from the annotations of ludb, the [0.05, 0.95] percentile of the durations of waves are
QRS complex: 70 - 144 ms
P wave: 60 - 134 ms
T wave: 116 - 240 ms
which roughly corr. to the following frequency bands:
QRS complex: 7 - 15 Hz
P wave: 7 - 17 Hz
T wave: 4 - 9 Hz
NOTE that there are records in ludb that there are no onsets (offsets) of certain waves.
in this case, the duration is from the peaks to the offsets (onsets).

according to ref [7], typical kernel sizes are 8 and 9
